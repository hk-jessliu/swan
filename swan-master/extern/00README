# Copy salted_spoofy.py to /usr/local/bin and 
# create a file in /etc/sudoers.d named "swan"
# with the following content:

# Cmnd alias specification
%salt ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/salted_swan.py


# Note! 
#
# 1. The last matching entry in the sudoers file will be 
#    evaluated for a user. If this is the "root ALL=(ALL) ALL
#    entry, sudo will request the password, even if the
#    salted_swan.py entry exists
#
# 2. You may want to use "Defaults !requiretty" as configuration
#    option. However, this only applies, if the distribution
#    is enforcing this.
